## Description

The Professional README Generator is a command-line application that helps developers create high-quality README.md files for their GitHub projects quickly. It streamlines the process by using the Inquirer package to dynamically generate the README based on user input.

With this tool, developers can focus more on building their projects and less on writing the documentation. The generated README includes essential sections such as Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions, following the best practices outlined in the Professional README Guide.

## Table of Contents

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [License](#license)

- [Tests](#tests)
- [Questions](#questions)
